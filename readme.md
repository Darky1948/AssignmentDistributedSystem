# Assignment 1 Distributed System

The purpose of this assignment is to introduce the student to high-level concurrent network programming and performance analysis of complex distributed systems.
In this assignment, the student are given the task of implementing a simple client that pulls data (pixel blocks) for a streaming video application, and (from the client's point of view) analyze the performance of the system. The video data is provided by a distributed video application consisting of a set of streaming services with interfaces for accessing video data in pixel blocks. To facilitate analysis of the system, a strictly hierarchical format for the video data is used.

* a (video) stream consists of a set of temporally ordered (video) frames,
* a frame consists of a set of spatially ordered (pixel) blocks, and
* a block consists of a set of spatially ordered (16x16) pixels
