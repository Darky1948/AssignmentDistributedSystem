The purpose of this assignment is to introduce the student to high-level concurrent network programming and performance analysis of complex distributed systems.
In this assignment, the student are given the task of implementing a simple client that pulls data (pixel blocks) for a streaming video application, and (from the client's point of view) analyze the performance of the system. The video data is provided by a distributed video application consisting of a set of streaming services with interfaces for accessing video data in pixel blocks. To facilitate analysis of the system, a strictly hierarchical format for the video data is used.

* a (video) stream consists of a set of temporally ordered (video) frames,
* a frame consists of a set of spatially ordered (pixel) blocks, and
* a block consists of a set of spatially ordered (16x16) pixels



Each service hosts a set of streams (identified by name), and each stream is homogeneous in format (all frames and blocks are the same size within a stream). To simplify reasoning about system performance trade-offs pixel blocks are transmitted in raw format (i.e. no video streaming or compression formats are used) in the assignment application. Note that this is an unrealistic artificial simplification that is unlikely to be found in real video streaming applications.

A simple framework that abstracts low-level system communication details is provided to allow the student to focus on the analysis parts of the assignment. 
The framework exposes a set of client stubs that can be used to communicate with services by exchanging [UDP-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) messages in a request-response pattern. The client stubs provide a very simple API that expose a set of data types and methods to retrieve video stream data from a host:

```
class Pixel
{
  byte r;              // red
  byte g;              // green
  byte b;              // blue
}

class Block
{
  Pixel[] pixels;      // 16x16 pixel block
}

class StreamInfo
{
  String name;         // stream name, non-empty string
  int lengthInFrames;  // #frames in stream
  int widthInBlocks;   // frame width (in blocks)
  int heightInBlocks;  // frame height (in blocks)
}
```

```
public interface StreamServiceClient
{
  public String getHost ();

  public StreamInfo[] listStreams ()
    throws IOException, SocketTimeoutException;

  public Block getBlock (String stream, int frame, int blockX, int blockY)
    throws IOException, SocketTimeoutException;
}
```


To instantiate the client stubs, use the bind() method in the DefaultStreamServiceClient class:

```
// host     = the name / ip address of the server to bind to
// timeout  = socket timeout in milliseconds
// username = student username (see explanation below)
StreamServiceClient client = DefaultStreamServiceClient.bind(host,timeout,username);
```


Use of the interfaces is demonstrated in an [example Java client](http://www8.cs.umu.se/kurser/5DV186/HT17/assignments/1/ExampleClient.java). The example can be run with a shell command similar to this
```
java -cp "5dv186a1.jar" se.umu.cs._5dv186.a1.client.ExampleClient harry.cs.umu.se 1000 test
```

(where harry.cs.umu.se is the host name, 1000 is the socket timeout in milliseconds, and test should be replaced with the student's username). Stream servers are installed on the following hosts:

* bellatrix.cs.umu.se
* harry.cs.umu.se
* dobby.cs.umu.se
* draco.cs.umu.se


For convenience, a service host list can be accessed through

```
String[] hosts = StreamServiceDiscovery.SINGLETON.findHosts();
```

This API is implemented in communication stubs in a provided UDP-based communication framework that is aimed to hide (some) low-level communication details and raise the abstraction level of the system communication.
Note that while the API defines blocking methods, it relies on an unreliable communication model, and users of the handed-out API (i.e. the students) need to manage issues arising from packet drops, e.g., handling packet resends using threading and invocation timeouts.
As noted in the interface, students are to provide their CS username as a parameter when instantiating and using the provided communication stubs. This is required as the provided application services contain individually configurable network quality rate limitations for link latencies and packet drop rates that are used to simulate variations in network link qualities.
The task of the student is to (using the provided communication stubs) implement video service clients and experimentally estimate the following performance metrics:

**Metric** | **Level** | **Unit**
------------ | ------------- | -------------
(UDP) packet drop rate (per service) | transport | percentage (%)
(average) packet latency (per service) | transport | milliseconds (ms)
(average) frame throughput | application | frames per second (fps)
bandwidth utilization (total network footprint) | application | bits per second (bps)

Student solutions shall implement a provided [FrameAccessor interface](http://www8.cs.umu.se/kurser/5DV186/HT17/assignments/1/FrameAccessor.java) (all referenced interfaces in the file), as well as construct a factory class that can be used to instantiate the interface (hint: one factory class per FrameAccessor implementation makes life easier). The factory classes shall implement the FrameAccessor.Factory interface and need to have a publicly accessible default constructor (a public constructor with no parameters).

A note on exceptions: The FrameAccessor interface is designed to support multiple different implementation patterns, and due to this, all potentially data-fetching methods list exceptions in the interface. However, this does not mean that a particular FrameAccessor implementation is expected to use data fetching methods (i.e. the underlying StreamSocketClient.getBlock()) in each of these methods - in fact, most FrameAccessor implementations will not.

Students are to implement two types of service clients: sequential and parallel; and to estimate and analyze the system performance in each mentioned dimension for both types of clients. The particular patterns of the parallel implementation are left to the student as part of the exercise, and the student is encouraged to experiment with different levels of parallelism in their communication patterns. Note: as the supplied video services contain individually configured network link simulators, students are likely to get varied results and values for these metrics.

## Build Environment 
Students shall provide an automated build script called build.sh (that could, e.g., be based on ant build files). Upon invocation, the build script shall produce a single JAR file named 5dv186a1_username.jar (where username is to be replaced with the student's username) containing all code needed to run the student's solution. 

**NOTE:** your code must be compilable using Java 1.8.

In addition to these files, the student shall also provide a text file named fqns.txt that specifies the fully qualified class names (class names including full package names, e.g., se.umu.cs._5dv186.a1.username.MyFrameAccessorFactory) of your FrameAccessor.Factory implementation class(es). For solutions with more than one factory class, specify one fully qualified class name per line in the file.

## Development Environment

For this assignment, students are provided a [UDP-based communication framework](http://www8.cs.umu.se/kurser/5DV186/HT17/downloads/5dv186a1.jar).
